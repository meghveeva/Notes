### Basic Overview
Those familiar with Checkmarx static analysis solutions are probably used to hearing us talk about onboarding applications in Checkmarx. And, there are many notions or perceptions about what that means exactly. So in this short module, our goal is to define application onboarding in terms of the goals we have for the process.  
  
One of the great things about Checkmarx is that itâ€™s easy to scan code and produce results. Because scanning with Checkmarx is so easy, considerations that may enhance the quality of scan results are often overlooked. These considerations are part of the application onboarding process and have the capacity to substantially improve Checkmarx results.
