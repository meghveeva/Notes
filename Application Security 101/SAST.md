(Static Application Security Testing)
___
Security testing which analyzes an applications source code or binary code to determine if security Vulnerabilities exit.

SAST solutions analyze the application 'from the inside-out', in many case SAST solutions do need compiled code.

###### Static Application secuirty testing ( [[SAST]] ) with secure SDLC
Static Application Security Testing is one the driving forcues behind the secure SDLC. SAST empowers developers to deliver secure applications by seamlessly integrating with their development processes and environments. 

In a secure SDLC, SAST solutions detect vulnerabilities which may expose the application to security risks and breaches. ![[Screenshot 2022-05-14 at 19.04.53.png]]
